            <h5>Population</h5>
            <p>According to the 2010 census carried out by the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses of Argentina (INDEC), Argentina had a population of 40,091,359 inhabitants, of which 1,805,957, or 4.6%, were born in other countries. The population
                growth rate in 2008 was estimated at 0.917% per year, with a birth rate of 16.32 live births per thousand inhabitants and a mortality rate of 7.54 deaths per thousand inhabitants.<br> Argentina has forty million inhabitants (the third
                largest on the South American continent), its demographic density is 15 inhab./k². More than ninety percent of people live in urban areas. The society is formed, mainly, by descendants of native peoples (Guarani, for example) and of people
                coming from Europe, being a country of many ethnicities.

                ethnic composition of Argentina was very similar to that of other Hispanic American countries, with a large part of the population being made up of mestizo descendants of Spanish men with indigenous women.

            <p>After Spanish colonization in Latin America, each country adapted its language by merging that of indigenous peoples with Spanish. If in Spain only the original Spanish is not spoken, let alone in another continent and in the extreme south
                of the world.<br>The Spanish spoken in Argentina is called Latin Spanish, which had its origins in Castilian. The term Castilian was given when the Kings of Castile reigned over Spain and the language was nicknamed in honor of them. Over

            <p>The cuisine of this country differs from the rest of Latin America due to the great European contributions: Italian and Spanish, which are two very important influences. This explains why meat is one of the main ingredients in this cuisine.
                Meat is usually accompanied by French fries, salads, provolone or provoleta (smoked provolone).<br>However, it seems to spread in Argentine restaurants the tendency to divulge traditional dishes rather than the typical dishes of the first
                inhabitants of the region.

                as it is called in western regions.<br>Argentine culture has its origins in a mixture of others that met during the period of immigration. As for ideologies, social democratic thought and language stand out, as well as faith in freedom,

            <h5>Government</h5>
            <p>
                Argentina is a constitutional republic and a representative democracy. The government is regulated by a system of three independent powers defined by Argentina's Constitution, which serves as the country's ultimate legislation. The seat of government
                is the city of Buenos Aires. Suffrage is universal, egalitarian, secret and mandatory.<br>Despite being declared the capital in 1853, Buenos Aires did not become the official capital until 1880. There were moves to move
                the administrative center elsewhere. During Raúl Alfonsín's presidency, a law was passed to transfer the federal capital to Viedma, Río Negro. Studies were underway when economic problems halted the project in 1989. Although the law was
                never formally repealed, it is now treated as a relic.
